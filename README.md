# Problem Statement:
University of Scholars, is an enterprise like East West University, owns many computers,
with a complex network infrastructure. Apart from wired internet access to all classrooms,
labs, employee PCs, library and other administrative and academic wings, the university also
provides wireless internet access for every campus. On top of that the university runs
complex networked systems to support several of its business processes like admissions,
advising, results, eTender, library management, accounts and so on.
This complex network infrastructure is subnetter and switching/routing mechanisms are in
practice.
# Tasks:
Your task is to create a complete model of a complex network by discovering the
interconnectivity of the systems and subnetworks, which will reflect the University’s structure
and facilities, features within the network will include the followings:

● Web page of the university will reflect the University of Professionals’ web page.

● A single DNS server needs to be installed to locate web server - meaning people will
browse University’s website with the following address: http://www.scholars.edu.bd

● Configure the whole network in such a way that IP for the hosts of different
campuses will be automatically assigned by a single DHCP server. If a single DHCP
is not doable by you, then use multiple DHCP servers; however, that will be
discredited.

● Among the hosts in a network make sure some wireless hosts are added in addition
to wired hosts.

● University’s full network has covered its seven campuses with seven routers;
Connections between the campus routers are given at figure 0; you will have to
follow the exact topology.

● Connectivity between all the hosts needs to be established.

While designing, keep the issue of future expansion/ growth in mind for each of the subnets
(if required) and preserve spaces. In the physical design, it is a good practice to have a
server room where all the servers are located in one LAN segment.
